### BRAIN WORKOUT is a first education project
### This is simple console application includes 5 math games such as:

1. ### - EVEN
    _**the user is shown a random number. And he should answer yes if the number is even or no if it is odd**_
2. ### - CALC
    _**the user is shown a random mathematical expression, for example 35 + 16, which you need to calculate and write down the correct answer.**_
3. ### - GCD
    _**the user is shown two random numbers, e.g. 25 50. The user must calculate and enter the greatest common divisor of these numbers.**_
4. ### - PROGRESSION
   _**Show the player a series of numbers that form an arithmetic progression by replacing any of the numbers with two dots. The player must identify this number.
   The recommended length of the progression is 10 numbers. The length can be randomly generated, but must contain at least 5 numbers!
   The position of the hidden element changes each time (chosen randomly).**_
5. ### - PRIME
   **_The user is shown a random number. You have to guess if it is prime. Answer 'yes' if given number is prime. Otherwise answer 'no'._**
